# TEC-284-Lab-15
Object detection with OpenCV and YOLO v11.

Lab_15_Start will do basic object detection with un-optimized model data. You will learn to fix this in the lab.

NCNN_Converter converts the neural network file into one optimized for ARM-based processors.

Lab_15_Hardware_Control turns on an LED on pin 16 (configurable) if a human (ID:0) or a book (ID:73) is detected.
